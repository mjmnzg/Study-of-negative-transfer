# Study-of-negative-transfer

This repository contains the implementations of VADA and SRDA used in the paper "A study of the effects of negative transfer on deep unsupervised domain adaptation methods". VADA and SRDA showed to be the best deep domain adaptation methods over synthetic data and three different real datasets for emotion recognition (SEED, SEED-IV and Stroke). We included all synthetic data and the code to generate different dataset shifts and negative transfers. SEED and SEED-IV can be downloaded at https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/~seed/seed-iv.html. Stroke dataset should be requested to the original authors.
