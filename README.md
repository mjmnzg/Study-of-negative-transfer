# Study-of-negative-transfer

This repository contains the implementations of VADA and RSDA reported in the paper "A study of the effects of negative transfer on deep unsupervised domain adaptation methods". VADA and RSDA showed to be the best deep domain adaptation methods over synthetic data and three different real datasets for emotion recognition (SEED, SEED-IV and Stroke). We included all synthetic data and the code to generate them. SEED and SEED-IV can be downloaded in https://bcmi.sjtu.edu.cn/~seed/seed-iv.html. Stroke dataset should be requested to the original authors.
